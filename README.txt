# Social Media App / Instagram

"Welcome to my social media app, an Instagram clone that brings the power of social media
to your fingertips! Dive into a world of sharing photos, connecting with friends, and 
exploring new content."

## Introduction

This project is an Instagram clone app developed to showcase my skills in full-stack 
web development. It serves as a culmination of my learnings from a medium-level course 
covering Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket principles. The app replicates key features
of Instagram, including user authentication, photo sharing, real-time messaging, and more.
Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in building complex web applications
and my ability to overcome various challenges in the development process.

## Why I Chose This Idea

The choice of this project stems from my completion of a medium-level course covering
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket principles. Eager to apply my newfound knowledge,
I sought to create a project that would incorporate both fundamental and challenging
aspects of HTTP APIs and socket-based chat applications. This led me to develop
an Instagram clone, providing an opportunity to implement key features such as
user authentication, photo sharing, real-time messaging, and more.

## Project Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Profile customization and controllerization
- Uploading and sharing photos and posts
- Liking, commenting, and interacting with posts
- Explore page for discovering new content
- Searching, Finding, Following and discovering other users
- Sending reports to admins
- Admin accessability and controllerization
- Direct messaging between users
- Variation in chats like single and group chat
- Full controlling in your chats
- Achieving accessability, performance and security

## Challenges and Solutions

1. In authentication future I used JWT package to handle access and refresh token.
   Also I handled all authentication constrains in backend as well as frontend to
   serve my business roles.

2. I had a challenge in uploading images for user avatar and posts images 
   so I used multer package to upload my images and saving them in uploads folder
   which exists in the backend.

3. I had a challenge in uploading images size which will be uploaded so I used sharp
   package to handle this issue.

4. I tried my best to make a standard server and client app folder and file structure.

5. I learned and used socket IO to build my chat future.

6. I handled my database collection and designed a ERD for it to view it for visitors
   so you will find project ERD in ./View/database_ERD.png.

7. Also there ara many challenges appears in creating APIs, layouts, responsive design
   structure, deployment, documentation, testing and many other challenges.
