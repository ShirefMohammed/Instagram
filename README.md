# Social Media App / Instagram

"Welcome to my social media app, an Instagram clone that brings the power of social media
to your fingertips! Dive into a world of sharing photos, connecting with friends, and 
exploring new content."

## Introduction

This project is an Instagram clone app developed to showcase my skills in full-stack 
web development. It serves as a culmination of my learnings from a medium-level course 
covering Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket principles. The app replicates key features
of Instagram, including user authentication, photo sharing, real-time messaging, and more.
Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in building complex web applications
and my ability to overcome various challenges in the development process.

## Why I Chose This Idea

The choice of this project stems from my completion of a medium-level course covering
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket principles. Eager to apply my newfound knowledge,
I sought to create a project that would incorporate both fundamental and challenging
aspects of HTTP APIs and socket-based chat applications. This led me to develop
an Instagram clone, providing an opportunity to implement key features such as
user authentication, photo sharing, real-time messaging, and more.

## Project Features

## Challenges and Solutions

1. Implementing authentication using JWT tokens for access and refresh tokens.
2. Managing image uploads for user avatars and posts using the Multer package.
3. Resolving issues related to image size by implementing compression with the Sharp package.
4. Establishing a standard folder and file structure for both the server and client app.
5. Learning and integrating Socket.IO for real-time chat functionality.
6. Designing and maintaining the database schema, visualized in the ERD located at ./View/database_ERD.png.
7. Utilizing Postman for API testing during development, with the collection available at ./view/Instagram.postman_collection.json.
8. Overcoming various challenges in API development, layout design, responsiveness, deployment, documentation, and testing.
